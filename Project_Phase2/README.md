## How to Run
1. Frist Run (`RDT2.2_reciver.py`)
2. Change (`scenario_mode.txt`) to desired secnario
3. Next run (in a seprate terminal) (`RDT2.2_sender.py`) to select secnario trasnmit .JPEG file
4. After transmission is complete, run (`PerformacePloter.py`) to output plot of RDT2.2 transmission time
