Differences from Phase 1B:
- Phase 1B only sent raw chunks of the file, without any protocol logic.
- Phase 5 is much more advanced:
What’s new / harder here:
- Instead of sending just the image bytes, we now send full TCP-like packets.
- Each packet includes:
        - sequence numbers
        - acknowledgments
        - flags (SYN, ACK, FIN)
        - checksums
        - length field
        - payload
- This is basically building a mini TCP from scratch on top of UDP.

Packet Structure (Phase 5):
Each packet we send has these fields:
- seq — the sequence number of the packet
- ack — acknowledgment number
- flags — can be SYN, ACK, FIN, DATA
- length — size of the payload
- checksum — CRC32 over header + payload
- payload — a chunk of the image file
This structure is used by both sender and receiver to make decisions about ordering, reliability, and connection state.

Main Program Flow (High-Level):
1. Start the receiver thread
- The receiver binds to a UDP port.
- It waits for SYN packets → completes the 3-way handshake.
- Then it listens for DATA packets and builds the image in order.

2. Read and split the input image
- We take the BMP image and split it into fixed-size chunks:

img_chunks = [chunk1, chunk2, chunk3, ...]

- Each chunk becomes the payload of one TCP-style segment.

3. Hand off everything to the sender
The sender:
- begins TCP Slow Start
- sends packets according to cwnd
- retransmits on timeout
- updates RTT and RTO
- handles duplicate ACKs for fast retransmit (Reno mode)
- sends FIN when done
This continues until all chunks are ACKed and the connection closes.
