Issues thats not in phase 1b:
    - just the chunk of the image is sent (easy)
    - opting to send full packet (data, seq_num, etc.) which is harder
        - becuase 

Packet Structure:
    self.seq 
    self.ack 
    self.flags 
    self.length 
    self.checksum 
    self.payload 

main:
    # Start reciver thread and sender

    # Split file into chunks
    img_in_chunks[1, 2, 3]

    # Handoff sender
