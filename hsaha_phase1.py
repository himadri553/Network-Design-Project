    Programming Project Phase 1

    The TCP/IP stack has five layers, namely application,
    transport, network, link, and physical. In Phase 1(a) of the project, each student must
    individually implement the standard user datagram protocol (UDP) sockets. The
    intention is to transfer a message (Say “HELLO”) from the UDP client to the UDP
    server and then ECHO the message back from the UDP server to the UDP client.
    Note that the client and server process can reside on the same host but have to use
    different port numbers. Make sure that your program can send and receive
    messages in both directions.
